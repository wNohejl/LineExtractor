/// Desk primitives wrap MudBlazor, and MudBlazor components resolve services out of the
/// container and reach for JS the moment they render. Registering both here means a test
/// states only what it is checking — a role, an aria attribute, a class, a callback — and
/// never the plumbing that got the component onto the page.
///
/// JSInterop is loose on purpose: the desk's own modules (desk-glide and friends) are
/// browser behaviour, not markup semantics, and a test that had to stub each import would
/// break every time a component picked up an animation.
